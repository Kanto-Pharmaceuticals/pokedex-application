# Pokedex Application

The Pokédex is a Full MERN Stack Application to catalogue and provide data on all the species of Pokémon featured in the video game, anime and manga series.

## Important

This repository was created as submodule of the [Pokedex](https://github.com/Kanto-Pharmaceuticals/pokedex) with the intention of re-using it's code for scaffolding other projects. It is important to have some knowledge of working with `git` and `submodules` in CLI in order to avoid breaking pointer references.
